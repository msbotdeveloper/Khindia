        <h3>The KH Story - 1947 Onwards</h3>
        <p id="a">M. A. Khizar Hussain Sahib took up the responsibility and challenge to create a new era in the leather industry in the small town of Melvisharam. Khizar Hussain Sahib had been in the leather trade for almost four decades before establishing M A Khizar Hussain & Sons in 1947. While in the trade, he had gained immense knowledge of all that was required and he implemented this learning in his firm. <br> <br>
            Khizar Hussain Sahib went about putting in place the most sophisticated equipment available at that time. The company began to produce EI tanned leather from raw hides and skins and soon entered the finished leather segment. Initially it’s speciality was baby buff-calf leather but later the company entered into other segments. <br> <br>
            In the year 1962, Khizar Hussain Sahib established KH Group and by the year 1973 the Group began producing fully finished leather. During this time many large clients from USA, West Germany, France, Italy among others began approaching the firm. <br> <br>
            In due course of time Mohamed Hashim Sahib, the present Chairman,  joined his father in growing the KH Group. It soon gained a reputation for quality buff-calf leather exports. After Mohamed Hashim Sahib's father passed away in 1976, he took over the group. Being a keen learner he had picked up many nuances of the trade which he was to implement over the <br> <br>
            
            In the year 1982, the Group started producing full shoes and it was not long before Mohamed Hashim Sahib diversified into making garments, wallets, bags, belts, gloves etc. He had by the late 1990's established an empire. The KH Group was noted as the most diverse leather enterprise in the country. The diversification over a long period was a well thought out strategy and all the companies were well integrated, from raw hides to final product. <br> <br>
        
            During the 1990s the third generation of entrepreneurs stepped in. Their energy and vision coupled with the guidance of Mohamed Hashim Sahib helped the Group take major initiatives and take the Group to new heights. <br> <br>
            
            From the early twenty first century, by 2010 onwards, the fourth generation is being  nurtured to take up the reigns of the Group. While the business has new hands and minds the overall ethos of the organization remains the same which is sure to benefit the Group as it gears up for the future <br> <br> <br></p>
